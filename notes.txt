//-set up notepad++
//-set up a midi controller and basic monitoring (aka Midi-OX)	 
//-get program from work laptop and working as-is
//-get some midi libarary(s) for python and start working with them
//-get midi output working - into MIDI-OX
//-?get a synth going so you can verify midi input?
//-display which midi in/out ports are available	
//-midi in/out ports set by persistent configuration
//-probably githubize	soon
//-try to measure performance.  is realtime realistic?	
//-mapping that's set by config

-is there a way to make a self-contained executable from my .py script?
	-ideally, it shows console for now (since that shows the midi inputs / outputs)
	https://packaging.python.org/overview/
		"...Bringing your own Python executable"
			py2exe looks promising
			**https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
				-DO A GITIGNORE TO NOT git-ize output folder!				
				just run 
					>> auto-py-to-exe
				seems to run: pyinstaller -y "C:/Users/Andrew/source/repos/pymidimapper/simpleMidiNoteMapper.py"
				-working, but with following caveats:
					-simpleMidiNoteMapper barfs on first line where it says
						//get it not barfing initiallly
							no module named 'mido.bakends.rtmidi'
								https://github.com/mido/mido/issues/17
								No module named 'mido.backends.rtmidi'
								try 
						-get it back to a working state and commit
							-can't get the output port to load.  not sure why
							
							-maybe need to try old script?
							-maybe need to try old setup (with the babyface, etc)
								
								
						
						
						-branch						
							-get the whole thing not barfing as exe						
							-try to get it going using PyInstaller directly						
							-make sure it's reading from the config file as exe
							-get it not barfing on a different machine
									
						
					
				

					

		



	
-now you're ready to try v0.1 on your music laptop!
	
-do some branching	
-any gui
-in the gui, display something from the configuration THAT'S READ AFTER THE PROGRAM STARTS


-way to choose midi input and output
-by able to load different profiles, perhaps many at a time (one per midi in/out port pair)

-find a way to simulate midi input?
-integrate virtual midi driver & make it be added dynamically?



LIBRARIES THAT NEEDED INSTALLING
	mido
	(MAYBE needed the C++ something something from MS for mido to work)

SOME OTHER HELPFUL CODE THAT GOT ME THERE
#   print(mido.get_input_names())
#   inport = mido.open_input('Babyface Midi Port 1 0') 
# Output Ports available on my "TOWER DEV MACHINE": 
# ['Babyface Midi Port 1 1', 'Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth 0', 'Springbeats vMIDI1 2', 'Springbeats vMIDI2 3', 'Springbeats vMIDI3 4', 'Springbeats vMIDI4 5', 'Springbeats vMIDI5 6', 'Springbeats vMIDI6 7', 'Springbeats vMIDI7 8', 'Springbeats vMIDI8 9']
