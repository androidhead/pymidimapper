//-set up notepad++
//-set up a midi controller and basic monitoring (aka Midi-OX)	 
//-get program from work laptop and working as-is
//-get some midi libarary(s) for python and start working with them
//-get midi output working - into MIDI-OX
//-?get a synth going so you can verify midi input?
//-display which midi in/out ports are available	
//-midi in/out ports set by persistent configuration
//-probably githubize	soon
//-try to measure performance.  is realtime realistic?	
//-mapping that's set by config


//-auto-py-to-exe DEPLOYMENT	
	
-now you're ready to try v0.1 somewhere besides dev pc!
	//-dell laptop	
	-music pc!
	
	

-probably cleanup/archive the unused scripts
-!!NEED TO HAVE BABYFACE PLUGGED IN FOR THINGS TO WORK SOMEHOW.  OTHERWISE OTHER MIDI PORTS WON'T OPEN
	-address this as possible
-do some branching	
-clean up .gitignore

-think about librarizing some of the components so not everything is in one file
-any gui
-in the gui, display something from the configuration THAT'S READ AFTER THE PROGRAM STARTS
-way to choose midi input and output
-streamline deployment
	-auto-py-to-exe "one file" deployment works to deploy a single exe with the caveat that you must manually copy in the config.json file
	-try to get it going using PyInstaller directly	
		-if so, put deployment commands in git'd code or git'd notes		
-by able to load different profiles, perhaps many at a time (one per midi in/out port pair)
-find a way to simulate midi input?
-integrate virtual midi driver & make it be added dynamically?





LIBRARIES THAT NEEDED INSTALLING
	mido
	(MAYBE needed the C++ something something from MS for mido to work)

SOME OTHER HELPFUL CODE THAT GOT ME THERE
#   print(mido.get_input_names())
#   inport = mido.open_input('Babyface Midi Port 1 0') 
# Output Ports available on my "TOWER DEV MACHINE": 
# ['Babyface Midi Port 1 1', 'Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth 0', 'Springbeats vMIDI1 2', 'Springbeats vMIDI2 3', 'Springbeats vMIDI3 4', 'Springbeats vMIDI4 5', 'Springbeats vMIDI5 6', 'Springbeats vMIDI6 7', 'Springbeats vMIDI7 8', 'Springbeats vMIDI8 9']
