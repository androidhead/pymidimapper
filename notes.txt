//-get basic midi i/o working to drive synth


//-understand i/o routing a little better

//-fix issues from trying 0.1 release on hp pc
	//-printing too many from console
	//-midi i/o from mapper not making it to synth
	//-merge branch
		


	

-probably cleanup/archive the unused scripts
-!!NEED TO HAVE BABYFACE PLUGGED IN FOR THINGS TO WORK SOMEHOW.  OTHERWISE OTHER MIDI PORTS WON'T OPEN
	-address this as possible
-do some branching	
-clean up .gitignore

-think about librarizing some of the components so not everything is in one file
-any gui
-in the gui, display something from the configuration THAT'S READ AFTER THE PROGRAM STARTS
-way to choose midi input and output
-streamline deployment
	-auto-py-to-exe "one file" deployment works to deploy a single exe with the caveat that you must manually copy in the config.json file
	-try to get it going using PyInstaller directly	
		-if so, put deployment commands in git'd code or git'd notes		
-by able to load different profiles, perhaps many at a time (one per midi in/out port pair)
-find a way to simulate midi input?
-integrate virtual midi driver & make it be added dynamically?
